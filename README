Hello, welcome, good morning, good night;

This is an early build of the schools database
It includes all of the equipment and some students as of this update.

    PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION AS OF THIS MOMENT
    
Contact William for further info and context on the project

Oh, and you can contact William to get a copy of the ERD for the database.
Keep in mind that the database and ERD is made to be universal for the other groups too, and it is therefore VERY open for everything.

:))



UPDATE:
I am working on the main frame of the PHP system
It is VERY experimental and bare bones, but it seems like a demo is going to be released soon.
Stay tuned and contact William for further info or a demo branch.

:)))



UPDATE 2:
I managed to get all of the usernames in the whole region, and I have added them to my dev branch. 
I don't know when the next update is, but I am trying to make a to-do list for the PhP branch and correcting the SQL branch
The back-end part of the project is starting to close off, but we are still missing the front-end and communicative parts.
I'll see what I can do to fix this, but in the meantime, I am stuck working on other projects and jobs.
Ask William if you need something or have any questions.

:))))
