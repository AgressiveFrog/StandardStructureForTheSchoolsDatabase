Hello, welcome, good morning, good night;

This is an early build of the schools database
It includes all of the equipment and some students as of this update.

    PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION AS OF THIS MOMENT
    
Contact William for further info and context on the project

Oh, and you can contact William to get a copy of the ERD for the database.
Keep in mind that the database and ERD is made to be universal for the other groups too, and it is therefore VERY open for everything.

:))
